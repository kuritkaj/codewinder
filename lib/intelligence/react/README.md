#ReAct Agent Library

## This library is a collection of TypeScript files and components designed to work with the Codewinder project. 
This library is focused on providing an AI-assisted code generation framework for React applications.

## Directory Contents
The `intelligence/react` subdirectory contains the following TypeScript files:

- `ActionEvaluator.ts`: Evaluates possible actions for the AI.
- `Director.ts`: Manages the overall flow and decision-making process of the AI.
- `MemoryCondenser.ts`: Condenses memories for better decision-making.
- `ReActAgent.ts`: Handles the core functionality of the AI React agents.
- `ReActAgentOutputParser.ts`: Parses the output of the AI React agents.
- `ReActExecutor.ts`: Executes the AI React agents' actions.
- `prompts.ts`: Contains prompts for the AI agents.

These classes/files handle decision-making, agent execution, and output parsing 
to provide reasoning and evaluation of a provided objective.

## Usage
To use this library, simply import the required components and functions into your React project. 
Make sure to properly configure your project to work with TypeScript files, and ensure that all dependencies are installed.
